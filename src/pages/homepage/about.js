          I currently am the Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://coursekeyeducation.com/" target="_blank">CourseKey Education</a>, which is where my passion for technology, learning,
          and entrepreneurship converge.
          I studied computer engineering and science at San Diego State University, where I co-founded student development
          firm called <a target="_blank" href="http://hitechedventures.org/">HiTech EdVentures (HTEV)</a>.
          Over the years, I developed software and consulted for multiple industries, including Healthcare, House
          Services, Entertainment, Automobile, and Education.
          Additionally, I worked as a consultant and contractor providing my services to different companies and startups
          through my personal business.
          Currently I am not accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get to know you, so donâ€™t hesitate
          to get in touch.
